Blogotext
=========
This is my fork of [Blogotext](http://lehollandaisvolant.net/blogotext/fr/). It's a light CMS by [Timo van Neerden](http://lehollandaisvolant.net/).

For now the only improvement is the addition of Flattr buttons on homepage and on each post.

Flattr Configuration
--------------------
You must configure Flattr for your account by modifing files *themes/yourtheme/list.html* and *themes/yourtheme/post.html*. 
All documentation is available on <http://developers.flattr.net/auto-submit/>. 

Also don't forget to put the Flattr Icon, which is in the default theme directory, in your theme directory. Be careful, but use and have fun with Flattr.

Changes coming

+  integrating configuration directly into admin panel, or at installation ?
+  put flattr button into rss feed ? Not so fond of it.
